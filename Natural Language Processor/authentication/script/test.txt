1.I must begin by saying that I watched this movie with my family (different people, different ages, different points of view). And that from the first few minutes there was around me a chorus of criticism about the total lack of logic or justification for a thousand details of the beginning of the narrative."Take it easy!" "This is only the beginning of the movie." "There will be an explanation for all that!" "...And the Art concept is cool, isn't it?"The problem was that the minutes passed and no explanation came for that huge bag of silliness and absurdity (only acceptable in this case because this is a fast-food movie, which it is supposed to be consumed without having your brain turned on?).I'm so sorry, guys. I've tried. Seriously. But there are things that get wrecked beyond salvation.
2.Watching DBE i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire Dragonball series. The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.For one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the "bullies" is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy (like they are in the anime) but just like slow motion fire.I could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire back-story of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask "Why did they make this movie for?" This     not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.As a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls.
