1.I just finished watching this and honestly found it to be one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. Long action scenes, well designed alien creatures and a good storyline. I was sceptical of it only being a 12 rating for a Sci fi but I was really pleasantly surprised. Yes it's long but it didn't drag and actually managed to get me to put my phone down and hold my attention.
2.After reading the review posted on here I decided that it was time to watch the movie. Since this person said it was horribly made, and I am such a big fan of DBZ I thought that maybe I should sign up and put my own opinion.First of all, I think that the movie started just as it should for people that have no idea what Dragonball is all about. I found the story line, acting, and special effects to be phenomenal. I personally cannot wait until the next one comes out. Obviously you have to be as big of a fan as I am to appreciate the excellent quality of this live action version of Dragonball. To wait as long as I have to see this movie the author of the main post on IMDp is obviously not a fan but just a critic that didn't do his homework and has never watched the anime version. At least not enough of the anime version to understand the storyline. This person only wanted to see huge Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha Waves and total destruction of cities and floating boulders from so much raw Ki power. That is not possible at this juncture of the story line, IDIOT!!!! The fight scenes, well one word- Awesome!!!! I personally suggest that anyone interested in Dragonball should watch this movie and understand it for what it is, if you know anything about the story line of the anime then you will know what I am talking about. I don't know the Japanese translation of the show however if the English dubs of the anime are in accordance with the Japanese spoken language minus the profanity then this movie is right on. This is the beginning of what I hope to be a series of great live action Dragonball movies. As always though someone from another country has a bur in their butt about the Americanized version of and over seas phenomenon.In closing I thought that the movie was great. Thanks for reading.
3.After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home.
