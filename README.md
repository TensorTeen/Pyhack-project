# Sentitment Analysis

## The Idea
We wanted to create a quick way to judge perception from text reviews. When we recently worked with a few Google forms, we realised the use case for such an application. Further applications of sentiment analysis in the context of high-frequency trading and, more generally, as a part of natural language processing motivated this project.

## The Target user
The project is designed to help someone who has to deal with a large volume of text-based reviews. With further refinement, this project can be used to estimate market sentiment about various stocks and commodities and be employed in financial institutions. The information gained through this program will be vital and insightful and be used to guide their trading decisions. This would make manual internet perusal to gain insights into market sentiments unnecessary.

## Why we chose this idea ?
Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks.
Todayâ€™s machines can analyse more language-based data than humans without fatigue and in a consistent, unbiased way. Considering the staggering amount of unstructured data that is generated every day, from medical records to social media, automation will be critical to comprehensively analyse text and speech data efficiently.

Human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. We express ourselves in infinite ways, both verbally and in writing. There are hundreds of languages and dialects, but each language has a unique set of grammar and syntax rules, terms and slang. We often misspell, abbreviate words, or omit punctuation when we write. We speak with regional accents, mumble, stutter, and borrow terms from other languages.

This project is our first foray into this vast subject.
